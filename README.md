### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a dedicated student with a great passion for technology and programming. I am currently attending the IBZ school in Basel, where I am deepening my knowledge in C#, web development and SQL. This formal education complements my personal passion for Python, a language I have explored and used extensively in my spare time.

On my GitHub profile, I present a selection of my personal projects that showcase my use of C#, Python and HTML/CSS/JS in various scenarios. From small automation scripts to more extensive applications, each project is a reflection of my learning journey and commitment to continuous improvement.

 Find out more about me and my projects on my website! Visit [my website](https://www.kalygin.ch/) for more info!
