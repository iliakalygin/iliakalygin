# Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Ilia, a dedicated student with a passion for technology and programming, currently studying computer science application
development at the IBZ school in Basel. There I am deepening my knowledge in C#, web development and SQL. In addition,
I have gained extensive experience with Python in my spare time. On my GitHub profile I show various projects that demonstrate
my skills in C#, Python and HTML/CSS/JS.

 Find out more about me and my projects on [my website](https://www.kalygin.ch/)!
